 abstract = {This book contains the refereed proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Agile Software Development, XP 2015, held in Helsinki, Finland, in May 2015. While agile development has already~become mainstream in industry, this field is still constantly evolving and~ continues to spur an enormous interest both in industry and academia. The XP conference series has always played, and continues to play, an important role in connecting the academic and practitioner communities, providing a forum for both formal and informal sharing and development of ideas, experiences, and opinions. The theme of XP 2015 {\dq}Delivering Value: Moving from Cyclic to Continuous Value Delivery{\dq} reflects the modern trend towards organizations that are simultaneously very efficient and flexible in software development and delivery. The 15 full and 7 short papers accepted for XP 2015 were selected from 44 submissions. All of the submitted papers went through a rigorous peer-review process. Additionally, 11 experience reports were selected from 45 proposals, and~in each case the~authors were shepherded by an experienced researcher},

 abstract = {DevOps for Developers delivers a practical, thorough introduction to approaches, processes and tools to foster collaboration between software development and operations. Efforts of Agile software development often end at the transition phase from development to operations. This book covers the delivery of software, this means ``the last mile'', with lean practices for shipping the software to production and making it available to the end users, together with the integration of operations with earlier project phases (elaboration, construction, transition).   DevOps for Developers describes how to streamline the software delivery process and improve the cycle time (that is the time from inception to delivery). It will enable you to deliver software faster, in better quality and more aligned with individual requirements and basic conditions. And above all, work that is aligned with the ``DevOps'' approach makes even more fun!    Provides patterns and toolchains to integrate software development and operations  Delivers an one-stop shop for kick-starting with DevOps  Provides guidance how to streamline the software delivery process},
